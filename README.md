# Datamigrato

Datamigrato is a versatile Python package dedicated to simplifying the process of migrating data across multiple databases, including Cassandra, MongoDB, Firebase, and Firestore. Designed with scalability, ease of use, and a well-maintained code structure in mind, it offers a comprehensive solution for various data transfer strategies and optimizations, making it an ideal choice for projects of all sizes and an accessible platform for contributors.

## Features

- **Wide Range of Database Support:** Migrate data between popular databases such as Cassandra, MongoDB, Firebase, and Firestore.
- **Scalability:** Engineered for scalability to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Ease of Use:** Simplifies the migration process, reducing the complexity involved in schema conversions, CRUD operations, and connection management.
- **Optimized Data Transfer:** Incorporates advanced data transfer strategies and optimizations to ensure fast and reliable migrations.
- **Well-Maintained Code Structure:** The codebase is organized and documented, facilitating easy understanding and contribution by developers.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Fully integrates into CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment, ensuring code quality and reliability.

## Installation

To install Datamigrato, simply use pip:

```bash
pip install datamigrato
```

## Quick Start

Here's how to quickly get started with Datamigrato:

```python
from datamigrato import Migrator

# Example: Migrate from MongoDB to Cassandra
migrator = Migrator()
migrator.mongo_to_cassandra(source_db_config, target_db_config)
```
Replace source_db_config and target_db_config with your database configurations.

## CI/CD Pipeline Integration

Datamigrato is designed to seamlessly integrate into CI/CD workflows:

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** During the CI phase, code is automatically checked, linted, and tested. We leverage FreeAPI, created by Hitesh Chaudhary and team, for live backend tests. This tool allows us to simulate real-world operations by populating a test database and performing migrations to ensure functionality.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** After passing CI tests, the code is reviewed and linted with Flake8 before being published to PyPI, ensuring that only high-quality code is deployed.
